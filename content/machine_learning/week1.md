#### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
1. Supervised Learning: data set is given, and right answer is given. In other words, using given data to predict requested result.
And there is **regression problem** and **classification problem**. For example, we can using data set of house size
compare to price to predict a specific house's price based on its size, this is a regression problem. Or, use data
set of breast tumor size compare to if it's malignant or benign to predict a specific size of tumor's condition, and
this is a classification problem. Notice, size of the house, and size of the tumor are **features**, for machine learning
problem, we can have infinite number of features to predict a result.

2. Unsupervised Learning: data set is given, but no right answer is provided. Machine is not told what to do. 
**clustering problem** is the most common algorithm. Algorithm will try to find the structure of the data set, for example, divide it into 
different group based on their features.

* Cocktail Party Problem: In a cocktail party, people are talking in different volume, language, all sounds are in a mess.
Using clustering algorithm, we can then try to separate each person's voice independently. 

* Regression:
